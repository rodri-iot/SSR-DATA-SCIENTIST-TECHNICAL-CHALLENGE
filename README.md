# SSR DATA SCIENTIST TECHNICAL CHALLENGE

## Google Analytics User Conversion Prediction

This repository contains the technical solution for the SSR Data Scientist Challenge, wich focuses on analyzing user behavior based on Google Analytics data from the Google Merchandise Store.

## Business Context

As a new data scientist on the team, you're asked to assist a client who has access to raw behavioral data but lacks expertise in interpreting it. Management is particularly interested in:
- Understanding who the users are and how they interact with the website
- Estimating the likelihood of user conversion (transaction) to support marketing campaigns
- Forecasting future sales based on user behavior trends
- Grouping users into behavioral segments for campaign optimization

## Project Objective

The selected approach addresses a core business need: predicting whether a user will convert (make a transaction) based on session-level features. This solution can be deployed immediately to improve marketing decisions and also serves as a foundation for forecasting future revenue.
